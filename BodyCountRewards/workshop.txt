description=[i]Finally, a mod where your body count actually matters.[/i]
description=[hr][/hr]
description=
description=Look, I'm not here to judge your... [i]numbers[/i]. Whether you're racking up zombie kills or just trying to survive another day, this mod rewards you for putting the undead back in the ground.
description=
description=Works in [b]Singleplayer[/b] and [b]Multiplayer[/b] - because your body count shouldn't depend on your social life.
description=
description=This started as my first PZ modding project for my private server, inspired by Circuit's [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3540255691]Kill Milestones (Zombies) B42[/url]. Great concept, but I wanted more control and features. So I built my own version from scratch.

description=
description=[h2]Why This One?[/h2]
description=The original mod is great, but I wanted more options for my server:
description=
description=[b]Core Features:[/b]
description=[list]
description=[*] [b]Full Stats UI[/b] - Three tabs: Progress, reward history, and player trait catalog with drop chances
description=[*] [b]Right-click context menu[/b] - Quick-check your kills and how many you still need til the next milestone
description=[*] [b]Smart trait conflict handling[/b] - Mutually exclusive traits are automatically resolved
description=[*] [b]Server-authoritative MP[/b] - All trait changes validated and applied server-side
description=[*] [b]Full Singleplayer support[/b] - Same features, no server needed
description=[/list]
description=
description=[b]Sandbox Options (all configurable by the host):[/b]
description=[list]
description=[*] [b]Kill threshold[/b] - Set how many kills per milestone (2 - 10,000)
description=[*] [b]Progressive milestone scaling[/b] - Milestones get harder over time, or keep it linear
description=[*] [b]Reward priority modes[/b] - Remove negatives first? Add positives first? Random coin flip?
description=[*] [b]Grant Missed Opportunities[/b] - Install the mod mid-game with thousands of kills? Get all your owed rewards at once instead of just one
description=[*] [b]Individual trait toggles[/b] - Enable/disable every single one of the 43 traits
description=[*] [b]Positive/negative rewards[/b] - Choose whether players earn positive traits, get negative ones removed, or both. Only want the good stuff? Disable negative removal. Only want to shed your weaknesses? Disable positive rewards. Your body count, your rules.
description=[/list]
description=
description=[hr][/hr]
description=
description=[h2]How It Works[/h2]
description=Kill zombies > Hit milestones > Get weighted-random trait rewards.
description=
description=Higher trait cost = lower drop chance. Simple as that.
description=
description=[b]Rarity Tiers:[/b]
description=[list]
description=[*] [b]Common[/b] (1-2 points) - Drops often
description=[*] [b]Uncommon[/b] (3-4 points) - Drops sometimes
description=[*] [b]Rare[/b] (5-6 points) - Drops rarely
description=[*] [b]Very Rare[/b] (7-8 points) - Good luck
description=[/list]
description=
description=[hr][/hr]
description=
description=[h2]How to Access[/h2]
description=Just right-click anywhere in the world.
description=
description=[list]
description=[*] [b]Right-click > "Body Count Rewards"[/b] - Opens the submenu
description=[*] [b]View Stats[/b] - Opens the three-tab statistics window
description=[*] [b]Progress display[/b] - Shows your current kills, next milestone, and kills remaining
description=[/list]
description=
description=[i]Everything updates in real-time. Kill a zombie, check your numbers. It's that simple.[/i]

description=

description=[h2]FAQ[/h2]
description=
description=[b]Q: Singleplayer or Multiplayer?[/b]
description=A: Both.
description=
description=[b]Q: Do I keep rewards if I disable the mod?[/b]
description=A: Yes. Traits are permanently applied to your character.
description=
description=[b]Q: I have thousands of kills but only got 1 reward?[/b]
description=A: Enable "Grant Missed Opportunities" in sandbox options to receive all your owed rewards.
description=
description=[b]Q: Why can't I get a specific trait?[/b]
description=A: Open the Stats UI > Catalog tab. It shows exactly why - you already have it, have a conflicting trait, or the admin disabled it.
description=
description=[b]Q: Linear vs Progressive scaling?[/b]
description=A: Linear = same kills for every milestone. Progressive = each milestone needs more kills than the last. The scaling factor (default 0.5) controls how steep it gets.
description=
description=[b]Q: Will you add Athletic/Strong/Fit?[/b]
description=A: Maybe! Those traits also grant perk points which need extra implementation. If enough people want it, I'll look into it.
description=
description=[b]Q: Works with existing saves?[/b]
description=A: Yes. Install it anytime - the mod reads your current kill count and calculates owed rewards.
description=
description=[b]Q: What happens when I've earned everything?[/b]
description=A: You've maxed out. The Stats UI will show a completion state.
description=
description=[b]Q: Does this work with traits from other mods?[/b]
description=A: No. Vanilla traits only until Build 42 hits stable.
description=
description=[b]Q: Can I switch from Kill Milestones (Zombies) to this mod?[/b]
description=A: Yes, no problem. Unsubscribe from KMZ, subscribe to this mod. Your kill count is stored on your character, so nothing is lost. Any traits you already earned stay permanently. Only the Reward History won't be filled - there is no way to tell how or when you got a trait.
